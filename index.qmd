# Introduction

**Portfolio Introduction**

This portfolio was created as part of the Data Science minor at Brigham Young University, showcasing my skills and experiences in three key areas: Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the knowledge I have gained throughout the program and how I have applied it to real-world data challenges.

While many of the projects were completed within a university setting and contain sensitive information that cannot be shared publicly due to academic integrity policies, I have included select projects that highlight my capabilities.
