Commit # 70

I started using the R studio renv package
- This project has its on library folder and r dependencies similar to the python .venv virtual folder. 
- visit this site for instrucitons: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/
Also like a commit or two ago I made a python .venv folder and added .Rprofile and .Renviron so the project uses that python folder for dependencies and not others outside the project root folder. 
- added the tinytex dependencies to the .venv folder and included in the project env .Rprofile and .Renviron
