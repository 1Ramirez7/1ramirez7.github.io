This interactive Short‑Run AD–AS Model lets you push fiscal and monetary levers in real time and watch output and inflation respond instantly—no static textbook graphs here. Built as a Shiny app for my Intermediate Macroeconomics course, the tool transforms AD-AS formulas into an exploratory sandbox where you can stress‑test policy scenarios, download the underlying data, and export publication‑ready plots in one click.
