Once you understand Bloomberg, then the other options will come in handy.\nSo we select ‘AMZN US Equity’ in this case.\nSecurity Description\nThe next image is a pop-up screen that appears after selecting AMZN US Equity. It will have many options, and many of the Bloomberg functions you will be using in the society and throughout the courses that require the use of Bloomberg will be in this pop-up menu.\n\nUnder Company Overview, we select ‘DES Security Description’ to view the about of a company and other key details. The image below shows what the DES Security Description should look like in your Bloomberg terminal.\nIn this screen, you can find many useful pieces of information about a company, including the tab for ratios.\nNote: once you search an equity or index in the Bloomberg terminal, it will be loaded automatically for any functions you search. Notice when you open a new tab, in the top left you can see “AMAZON.COM INC equity” so any related function you search in Bloomberg will be loaded using the currently loaded equity or index.\n\n\n\nFinacial Analysis of AMZN\nTo view the FA for AMZN, just search ‘FA’ in the blue box. You can do it on the DES page or just open a new tab.\nIf I could recommend any of you to familiarize yourself with any Bloomberg function, this would be one of the main ones and will make your life easier, even for non-financial econ and/or econ courses.\n\nOverview.\n\nIncome Statement\nBalance Sheet\nCash Flow\nRatios\nand my favorite ‘Custom’\n\n\nThis is like the best place to find ratios and specific information about a company.\n\nCreate Custom\nSave it after a few fields have been entered even if you are not done, because leaving that page will delete any unsaved progress.\n\n\nWAY TO MANY OPTIONS IN BLOOMBERG\n\nWhen doing course assignments, explain how you attain the ratios or fields due to ratios having different values.\n\n\nRight click on a field and select ‘definition’.\n\nMost of the time, the definition of a field will let you know if you are looking at the correct field for your research project.\n\nAdd as many fields as needed.\n\nRight next to the ‘’ option, you have the save option.\n\nPick a name for your template and save it.\nPick names that can be easily indentified even semesters later.\nDelete any one time use templates.\n\n\nTo edit a saved template, simply enter a field normally and remember to save.\n\n\nThroughout your courses, you will always be doing repetitive tasks in Excel. So, it will be useful to create an Excel template where you can simply copy and paste from a Bloomberg export Excel file into your model. As you improve your research skills, having an Excel model that automatically performs calculations and predictions on given data will make your student life a lot easier.\n\nMany of the definitions on the Bloomberg Terminal will provide you with the calculations for the function you are using.\n\n\n\npsacer\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Time Series Decomposition\n\nUnderstanding Decomposition\nTime series decomposition breaks down data into three components: trend, seasonality, and irregularities. This helps us understand underlying patterns and make better forecasts.\n\n\nWhy Use a Multiplicative Decomposition?\nThe upward trend in China’s export data suggests that fluctuations in seasonality and irregularities increase in magnitude as exports grow. That’s why we use a multiplicative classical decomposition model, where the data is broken down into:\n\nTrend Component: Captures the long-term growth pattern. Here, we observe steady growth in exports.\nSeasonal Component: Identifies repeating patterns within a year. Exports peak in December (possibly driven by holiday demand, especially in the US) and dip to their lowest in February (likely due to the Chinese New Year and post-holiday slowdowns).\nRandom Component: Captures what’s left after accounting for the trend and seasonal components. It represents what the model cannot explain. These unexpected changes often correlate with macroeconomic events like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, but not all irregular variations can be directly linked to specific events.\n\n\n\nMultiplicative Classical Decomposition Model\n\n\nShow the code\nchina_decompose_mult &lt;- cexports_ts |&gt;\n  model(feasts::classical_decomposition(exports_commodities, type = \"mult\"))  |&gt;\n  components()\n\ndecompose_plot &lt;- autoplot(china_decompose_mult) +\n  ggtitle(\"Fig 2 - Classical Multiplicative Decomposition of China's Exports\") +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Export commodities = trend (billions) * seasonal * random\")\n\ndecompose_plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 2 - Classical Multiplicative Decomposition of China’s Exports\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Save the plot as a PNG file\n#ggsave(\"fig2_mult_decomposition.png\", plot = decompose_plot, width = 12, height = 6, dpi = 300)"

For example, in response to a slowdown (random shock), China increased export tax rebates in March 2015 to stimulate exports, showing how responses can occur after the initial shock. This randomness highlights inherent uncertainties—macroeconomic disruptions may explain some shocks, but many remain unpredictable. Understanding the random component helps us see where patterns could align—but also where uncertainties remain.\n\n\nShow the code\nhighlight_months &lt;- c(\"1992 Oct\", \"1994 Jan\", \"1994 Apr\", \"1994 Sep\", \n                      \"1995 Dec\", \"1997 Jul\", \"1998 Jan\", \"1999 Apr\", \n                      \"1999 Nov\", \"2001 Dec\", \"2003 Apr\", \"2004 Jul\", \n                      \"2005 Jul\", \"2008 Sep\", \"2008 Nov\", \"2009 Jun\", \n                      \"2010 May\", \"2010 Dec\", \"2015 Mar\", \"2017 Jan\", \n                      \"2018 Jul\", \"2019 Oct\", \"2019 Dec\", \"2020 Jan\", \n                      \"2020 Mar\")\n\nhighlight_dates &lt;- tsibble::yearmonth(highlight_months)\n\nplot_random_component &lt;- ggplot(china_decompose_mult %&gt;% \n                                  filter(index &gt;= yearmonth('1992 Jul') & \n                                         index &lt;= yearmonth('2023 Dec')), \n                                aes(x = index, y = random)) +\n  geom_line(group = 1, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data = china_decompose_mult %&gt;% filter(index %in% highlight_dates),\n             aes(x = index, y = random),\n             shape = 24, color = \"red\", fill = \"red\", size = 4) + \n  labs(title = \"Fig 4 - Exports Commodities Random Component vs Macroeconomic Events\",\n       x = \"\",\n       y = \"Random\") +\n  scale_x_yearmonth(\n    labels = scales::label_date(\"%Y %b\"),  \n    breaks = \"36 months\"                    \n  )\n\nplot_random_component\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 4 - Exports Commodities Random Component vs Macroeconomic Events\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n# Save the plot as a PNG file\n#ggsave(\"fig4_random_vs_macroeventns.png\", plot = plot_random_component, width = 12, height = 6, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\nWhy a Multiplicative Decomposition Model Fits\nThe multiplicative model is particularly suitable because the amplitude of seasonal changes and irregular fluctuations increases along with the trend. In China’s export data, as exports grow, the seasonal variations and irregularities also become more pronounced. A multiplicative model accounts for this proportionality, making it appropriate for capturing the dynamics of the data.\n\n\nWhy an Additive Decomposition Model Would Not Work\nAn additive model assumes that the size of seasonal and irregular variations remains constant regardless of the trend. However, the data shows that fluctuations grow as the trend grows. Therefore, an additive model would fail to accurately represent the increasing variability linked to higher export levels.\n\n\nAdditive Classical Decomposition Model Plot\n\n\nShow the code\nchina_decompose_add &lt;- cexports_ts |&gt;\n  model(feasts::classical_decomposition(exports_commodities, type = \"add\"))  |&gt;\n  components()\n\nautoplot(china_decompose_add) +\n  ggtitle(\"Fig 5 - Classical Additive Decomposition of China's Exports\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFig 5 - Classical Additive Decomposition of China’s Exports"

However, based on historical patterns, China has demonstrated resilience and the ability to recover fairly quickly from these disruptions. Therefore, we recommend the following actionable items:\n\nDiversify Supply Chains: Identify and establish relationships with alternative suppliers and markets to reduce dependence on China during potential disruptions.\nIncrease Inventory Buffer: Build up inventory reserves during periods of high export activity to prepare for potential downturns caused by political events.\nMonitor Key Indicators: Closely monitor geopolitical developments and economic indicators to respond proactively to any signals of impending disruptions.\nEstablish Contingency Plans: Develop and maintain contingency plans to address short-term declines in supply, including logistical adjustments and finding new suppliers.\nCommunicate with Partners: Maintain open communication with Chinese suppliers and partners for early warnings of potential issues.\nLeverage Seasonal Patterns: Use the identified seasonal peaks to strategically schedule production and export needs, ensuring that reserves are built up during times of predictable high export activity."

While upcoming political events may lead to short-term declines, historical data shows that these are typically followed by rapid recovery. By understanding these trends, seasonality, and random components, businesses can better prepare for potential disruptions without significant long-term impacts.\nThe key insight is that while risks are present, proactive preparation can mitigate their effects. By leveraging strategic planning, maintaining communication, and building contingency buffers, companies can continue to operate smoothly and minimize disruptions. This approach ensures resilience in the face of political uncertainties, relying on the observed adaptability of China’s export capabilities.\nWhat’s Next?

The Fisacal policy cause output and inflation to sky rocket in 2021 so I started rasing rates in 2021 and it 2023 my rates where at 5.68 and kept them there for the next 3 years or till 2025. In 2027 rates where back to 2. In 2027 or period 12 output was just above potential, but the recent high rates still had effects for the next two periods (28-29) output shot below potential which can be the recession that was anticipated at the beginning of covid. In the year 2030 the recession is no more, inflation is back at the fed target of 2, output is stabilize or at zero, real interest rates are at 12 and no more crazy shocks with a. I tried to simulate the current situation in the economy by using part 3.1 plots to generate the first set of plots for part 3.2. I got them to be very similar during covid, and in that simulation in the year 2030 things seem to be back to normal but inflation was still above the fed target rate. By taking a more agressive approach to the interest rate, I was able to nring down inflation, to its target and everything else normal by 2030, but it did cost a lot of jobs.

Below are excerpts of their stance on interest rates now and in the near future. Translate these into parameter values n and m. How does changing the parameters of the policy rules affect the behavior of short-run output and inflation? Explain\nFederal funds rate: The Fed has cut its target for the federal funds rate, the rate banks pay to borrow from each other overnight, by a total of 1.5 percentage points since March 3, 2020, bringing it down to a range of 0% to 0.25%. The federal funds rate is a benchmark for other short-term rates and also affects longer-term rates, so this move is aimed at lowering the cost of borrowing on mortgages, auto loans, home equity loans, and other loans, but it will also reduce the interest income paid to savers.\nForward guidance: Using a tool honed during the Great Recession of 2007-2009, the Fed has offered forward guidance on the future path of its key interest rate, saying that rates will remain low “until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.” This forward guidance on the overnight rate, updated in September 2020 to reflect the Fed’s new monetary policy framework, puts downward pressure on longer-term rates.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "Analyzing Firm’s Working Capital Policy Trends\nWorking Capital is in a bad place for RDUS as they are relying more on long-term debt to finance asset requirements and have very little to no cash at all. As shown in the Financial leverage figure. RDUS is already hurting from the amount of debt they have, and the green line suggests they will be better off not taking on debt. Given this scenario, RDUS would be better off keeping a compromise policy by relying more on short-term borrowing, and as suggested in term report 2, for them to sell some of their underperforming assets and focus on improving liquidity.\nThe figure below has 3 markers for each line. The markers represent 3 scenarios: Recession, current, and boom. The left marker represents RDUS financial leverage during a hypothetical recession, the middle marker is as the economy is now, and the right marker represents a boom in the economy.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport numpy as np\nx1_values = [-35170.11, -22987, -10803.89]; y1_values = [-1.262251373, -0.825000897, -0.387750422]\nx2_values = [-35170.11, -22987, -10803.89]; y2_values = [-2.179242006, -1.304741054, -0.430240103]\nm1, b1 = np.polyfit(x1_values, y1_values, 1); m2, b2 = np.polyfit(x2_values, y2_values, 1)\nx1_regression_line = np.linspace(min(x1_values)-60000, max(x1_values)+120000, 100); y1_regression_line = m1 * x1_regression_line + b1\nx2_regression_line = np.linspace(min(x2_values)-60000, max(x2_values)+120000, 100); y2_regression_line = m2 * x2_regression_line + b2\ntrace1 = go.Scatter(x=x1_values, y=y1_values, mode='markers', name='', showlegend=False); trace2 = go.Scatter(x=x2_values, y=y2_values, mode='markers', name='', showlegend=False)\nregression_trace1 = go.Scatter(x=x1_regression_line, y=y1_regression_line, mode='lines', name='Proposed'); regression_trace2 = go.Scatter(x=x2_regression_line, y=y2_regression_line, mode='lines', name='Current')\nfig = go.Figure(); fig.add_trace(trace1); fig.add_trace(trace2); fig.add_trace(regression_trace1); fig.add_trace(regression_trace2)\nfig.update_layout(title='Financial leverage: Debt vs No Debt', xaxis_title='Earnings before Interest & Taxes', yaxis_title='Earnings per Share ($)', xaxis=dict(range=[min(x1_values + x2_values)-20000, max(x1_values + x2_values)+60000], zeroline=True, zerolinewidth=2, zerolinecolor='black'), yaxis=dict(range=[min(y1_values + y2_values)-0.5, max(y1_values + y2_values)+2.5], zeroline=True, zerolinewidth=2, zerolinecolor='black'))\nfig.show()\n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nThe financial leverage of RDUS would suggest not to take on debt, and consider selling underperforming assets as mentioned in term two report. Later research on this report would support that the economy is heading closer to a recession than a boom so RDUS is better off with no debt. In relation to this project, RDUS is better off using short-term debt and liquidity to finance their working capital, and it will be explained below.\n\n\nCurrent trends in ARS for RDUS\nLooking at the Scatterplots below, we can see RDUS and its competitors would benefit from increasing credit, besides NVRI, which is worse off extending credit. RDUS Net Income shows that other things affect it most, compared to CLH, where AR explains 66% of the changes in Net Income.\nValue of Credit Analysis scatterplots for all firms\n\n\nShow the code\n# scatter plot for all firms.

Two of the lowest markers for RDUS are from the last two quarters of 2023. In Q3, they had NI of -25m and AR of 210m, and in Q4, they had an NI of -17m and AR of 218m. This is not good as their historical average is NI: 19m and AR: 194m, and their average for the 10 lowest quarters of AR from 2016 to 2023 is NI: 8m and AR: 134m.\nRDUS Value of Credit Analysis Scatter Plot\n\n\nShow the code\n# scatter plot for only one firm.

The investment in receivables only explains 18% of the changes in Net Income. Based on the investment in receivables research, RDUS can benefit from extending the credit as the scatter plots show NI will go up. Yet, the fact this method only explains 18% of NI, and the last two quarters from 2023, RDUS had higher than average AR, but nearly 200% below the average for NI. The standard deviation for RDUS in this Scatterplot is 24m, but their average for the last two quarters in 2022 is approximately 40m. This shows that RDUS can increase credit, but the 82% not explained by this linear regression is alarming, and extending credit will not help RDUS based on their recent history.\n\n\nPermanent Working Capital and Book Leverage\nRDUS’s permanent working capital needs are increasing, primarily due to its expansion and operational inefficiencies. This increase in permanent working capital needs significantly affects the company’s book leverage. To meet these growing working capital requirements, RDUS has been increasingly relying on long-term debt. This is evident from the rising debt-equity ratio and equity multiplier, as highlighted in the term two report. This heightened dependency on debt alters the company’s capital structure, making it more leveraged.\nThe effects of this increased leverage are multifaceted. Firstly, it leads to a higher weighted average cost of capital (WACC), as borrowing costs rise with the increased perception of risk by creditors. This higher WACC, in turn, affects the company’s investment decisions and could potentially lower its valuation.\nThe reliance on debt puts a strain on RDUS’s liquidity, as seen in the declining current and quick ratios. This situation implies that the company might struggle to meet its short-term obligations, thereby increasing financial risk.\nThe shift towards debt financing, while providing necessary funds in the short term, has negative implications for the company’s long-term financial health. It increases the risk of financial distress, especially if RDUS is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service its debt obligations.\ntime series graph of Book leverage\n\n\nShow the code\n# time series graph of Book leverage\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\ndf = pd.read_excel(\"C://Users//eduar//OneDrive - BYU-Idaho//BYUI//2024_1 Winter//455 ECON//1 Final term paper//data//DATAVS.xlsx\")\nq_rdus = df['Q_RDUS'] \nbook_leverage_rdus = df['43Book  Leverage_RDUS']\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q_rdus, y=book_leverage_rdus, mode='lines+markers', name='Book Leverage'))\nfig.update_layout(title='Relationship of RDUS with Book Leverage', xaxis_title='Quaters', yaxis_title='Book Leverage', legend_title='Variable') # edit text\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nRDUS’s increasing permanent working capital needs have led to a more leveraged book position, as indicated by its growing reliance on long-term debt. This shift in capital structure not only raises the company’s financial risks but also impacts its cost of capital and overall financial flexibility. To mitigate these issues, RDUS might need to explore strategies to improve its operational efficiency, reduce debt, and potentially rebalance its capital structure towards a more sustainable model.\n\n\nTemporary Cash Surpluses, Marketable Securities, and Idle Cash\nGiven RDUS’s challenging working capital situation and their increasing reliance on long-term debt, it seems possible that temporary cash surpluses might indeed be necessary. These surpluses could serve as a buffer against liquidity constraints, especially since access to marketable securities appears to be limited, likely due to a decrease in such holdings to manage short-term financial obligations.\nCommon stock vs last price graph\n\n\nShow the code\n# Common stock vs last price graph \nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\ndf=pd.read_excel(\"C://Users//eduar//OneDrive - BYU-Idaho//BYUI//2024_1 Winter//455 ECON//1 Final term paper//data//DATAVS.xlsx\")\nq, common_stock, last_price=df['Q_RDUS'],df['25Common Stock_RDUS'],df['24Last Price_RDUS']\nfig=go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q,y=common_stock,mode='lines+markers',name='Common Stock'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q,y=last_price,mode='lines+markers',name='Last Price',yaxis='y2'))\nfig.update_layout(title='Common Stock vs Last Price',xaxis_title='Quarters',yaxis=dict(title='Common Stock (in thousands)',side='left'),yaxis2=dict(title='Last Price',side='right',overlaying='y',showgrid=False),legend_title='Variable')\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nRDUS might find itself with idle cash for several reasons, such as conservative cash management practices amidst economic uncertainty or perhaps due to timing differences between cash inflows from operations or financing activities and cash outflows for investments or debt servicing. The recent negative trends in net income and the increase in accounts receivable could indicate a mismatch in the cash conversion cycle, resulting in idle cash.\n\n\nAnalysis of Firm’s Receivable Investments\nRDUS’s investment in receivables, at 11% of total assets for the fourth quarter of 2023, represents a considerable allocation of resources, slightly below the seven-year quarterly average of 14%. This indicates a slight recent decline in the proportion of assets tied up in receivables. Looking at the trend in the days accounts receivable, represented by the blue line, there appears to be significant variability, with some peaks and troughs indicating a fluctuating collection period. It’s clear there are cycles where the days receivable increase sharply, suggesting periods where RDUS may struggle to collect payments promptly. This inconsistency could impact liquidity and cash flow management.\nTime Series: Trend and Cycle for RDUS days accounts\n\n\nShow the code\n# time series for RDUS days accounts \nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\ndf = pd.read_excel(\"C://Users//eduar//OneDrive - BYU-Idaho//BYUI//2024_1 Winter//455 ECON//1 Final term paper//data//DATAVS.xlsx\")\nq_rdus = df['Q_RDUS'] # edit variable\ndays_sales_receivables_rdus = df[\"60Day's sales in receivables_RDUS\"] # edit variable\ndays_sales_inventory_rdus = df[\"58Day's sales in inventory_RDUS\"] # edit variable\npayable_turnover_rdus = df['62payable turnover_RDUS'] # edit variable\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q_rdus, y=days_sales_receivables_rdus, mode='lines+markers', name=\"Receivables\")) # edit names/titles\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q_rdus, y=days_sales_inventory_rdus, mode='lines+markers', name=\"Inventory\")) # edit names/titles\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=q_rdus, y=payable_turnover_rdus, mode='lines+markers', name='Payable')) # edit names/titles\nfig.update_layout(title='Time Series line Grpah for RDUS Days accounts variables: Receivables, Inventory, and Payables', xaxis_title='', yaxis=dict(title=\"Days\", side='left'), legend_title='Variable') # edit names/titles\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nIn contrast, the days accounts payable, denoted by the green line, show less volatility, with generally more stable, albeit still fluctuating, periods indicating the company’s payment to its suppliers. The trend seems to be moderately cyclic, with no dramatic spikes similar to those seen in receivables. This relative stability in payables suggests a more consistent approach to managing payables compared to receivables. The firm’s strategy for managing payables may reflect an attempt to maintain cash on hand or favorable credit terms with suppliers.\n\n\nFuture Strategies for Working Capital\nYield curves and Recession predictions\nThe 10, and 3 year treasury yield, and the spread between the two which can be refer to as the yield curve between the two. This yield curve is also widely use to project the health of the economy and is usually use to predict recessions. What better example then a few day old post by Yahoo Finance. “A 2/10 curve inversion is a time-honored signal of an upcoming recession. Short-term bonds yield more than longer maturities because investors expect interest rates to remain high in the short term as the Federal Reserve battles inflation, while long yields are lower on expectations the central bank will cut interest rates to stimulate a weakening economy.”\nA normal yield curve indicates a healthy economy, while a flat yield curve (when the spread is almost zero) would signal uncertainty about future economic growth, and an inverted yield curve is where short-term yields are higher than long term yields. An inverted yield curve is a warning sign for economic recession.\nIn the graph below we always want the 10 year US treasury note yield (DGS10: royalblue line) to be above the 3 year yield (DTB3: green line). We also want The fed funds rate (FEDFUNDS: purple line) to be below the 10 year yield.\nThe Recession Indicator (JHDUSRGDPBR) figure has two lines, the spread line represents the spread between the 10-year and the 3-year yields or 10y yield minus the 3-year yield. A high spread correlates with a healthy economy, and a negative spread, like the 2/10 curve example from the quoted article, would signal warnings of inflation. The second line ‘JHDUSRGDPBR’ is a recession indicator. A 1 in the recession indicator basically means that there would or probably will be a recession in about 4 quarters. For example, looking at the figure, the JHDUS line had a 1 in early 2020, and we were supposed to hit a recession early 2021, or so we thought. We supposedly haven’t hit a recession. The yield curve for the 3/10 has been negative since October 2022, so that is a good warning for an economic recession. The Recession Indicator is still at zero, but based on this analysis and to answer the question of the project, RDUS is better off with short-term financing.\nSince October 2022, the 10-year Treasury yield (long-term rate) has been below the 3-year Treasury yield, while the 3-year Treasury yield (short-term rate) has been above the long-term rate. Given that the long-term rate is lower than the current short-term rate, it suggests that interest rates are expected to decrease (the Fed is siding with lowering the rates rather than increasing as well). In such a scenario, it is advantageous for RDUS to finance working capital with short-term debt, with the expectation of refinancing at lower rates in the future. Doing the calculations in the term 4 instructions using the yields for 2023 would also suggest the short-term option to finance working capital.\nSpread and recession graphs\n\n\nShow the code\n# ECON 355 yield curve projet with updated data\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfile_path_new = \"C://Users//eduar//OneDrive - BYU-Idaho//BYUI//2024_1 Winter//381 ECON//IS-MP Simulations//fredgraph.csv\"\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(file_path_new)\ndf_new['DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df_new['DATE'])\nstart_date_new = '2013-01-01'  # edit data\nend_date_new = '2023-12-31'\nmask_new = (df_new['DATE'] &gt;= start_date_new) & (df_new['DATE'] &lt;= end_date_new)\nfiltered_df_new = df_new.loc[mask_new]\nfile_path = \"c://Users//eduar//OneDrive - BYU-Idaho//BYUI//2023_9 Fall Semester//Econ 355//5 Project  - Yield Curves and Macroeconomic Performance//355ECON Project data.xlsx\"\n\n\ndf = pd.read_excel(file_path)\ndf['Spread Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Spread Date'])\nstart_date = '2013-01-01' # edit date\nend_date = '2023-12-31'\nmask = (df['Spread Date'] &gt;= start_date) & (df['Spread Date'] &lt;= end_date)\nfiltered_df = df.loc[mask]\nfig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('Yield Plot', 'Recession Indicator (JHDUSRGDPBR) vs 10 & 3 year note Spread'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=filtered_df_new['DATE'], y=filtered_df_new['DGS10'], name='10-Y Treasury yield', mode='lines', line=dict(color='royalblue')), row=1, col=1)\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=filtered_df_new['DATE'], y=filtered_df_new['DTB3'], name='3-Y Treasury yield', mode='lines', line=dict(color='green')), row=1, col=1)\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=filtered_df_new['DATE'], y=filtered_df_new['FEDFUNDS'], name='FEDFUNDS', mode='lines', line=dict(color='purple')), row=1, col=1)\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=filtered_df['Spread Date'], y=filtered_df['Spread'], name='Spread'), row=1, col=2)\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=filtered_df['Spread Date'], y=filtered_df['JHDUSRGDPBR'], name='JHDUSRGDPBR'), row=1, col=2)\nfig.update_layout(height=600, width=1200, title_text=\"\")\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nRDUS’s bad investment decisions and poor capital structure have not put them in a good place, and with the negative yield curve, it is not looking good for the economy. RDUS can explore opportunities like selling underperforming assets, of which they have plenty, as this will help lower their operating costs, decrease expenses, and alleviate some of their debt, as many of their assets are tied to long and short-term debt, as well as contractual obligations. Another opportunity for RDUS is to prepare for bankruptcy and see how to best lower the cost of bankruptcy and maximize the value of their assets before selling.\n\n\nConclusion\nI found that RDUS’s working capital position is weak, largely due to an over-reliance on long-term debt and insufficient cash reserves. This situation suggests that a compromise policy, balancing short-term borrowing with the sale of underperforming assets to improve liquidity, would be more beneficial. The financial leverage analysis indicates that RDUS should avoid further debt, especially with the economic indicators pointing towards a recession. This approach aligns with the company’s need to manage working capital more effectively using short-term debt.\nRegarding receivables, RDUS would benefit from extending credit as it positively impacts their net income, but the impact is limited, explaining only 18% of net income variations. The trend in accounts receivable indicates inconsistent collection periods, which complicates cash flow management. RDUS’s increasing permanent working capital needs and growing reliance on long-term debt have led to higher financial risks, including a more leveraged book position and a higher weighted average cost of capital.\nConsidering the yield curve analysis, the economic indicators suggest a looming recession. This scenario makes short-term debt financing more favorable for RDUS, allowing for refinancing at potentially lower rates in the future. To address its poor investment decisions and capital structure, RDUS should consider selling underperforming assets to reduce debt and prepare for a potential economic downturn “possible bankrupcty”.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

    "text": "At the beginning of 2021, Radius Recycling (RDUS) exhibited a promising upward trajectory in earnings, with fluctuations throughout the year. Yet, by the end of 2022, despite making strategic capital investments in acquiring ten new properties, their sales did not reflect the anticipated growth from these investments. From Q2 of 2023, a noticeable decline in revenue became evident. This downturn, potentially a result of the prevailing economic conditions, might suggest a future recovery, thus positioning RDUS’s stock, currently trading near the lower Bollinger bands, as a potentially undervalued asset. A deeper examination into their capital structure reveals a dramatic shift: the EPS growth rate soared by 4027% from 2021 to 2022, yet it plateaued with a mere 2% increase in 2023. The first quarter of 2024 marked a concerning trend with a -115% decline in growth.\nThe year 2022 marked a significant period for RDUS, with a substantial increase in assets between Q2 and Q3. This period saw a rise not only in revenue but also in liabilities, property/plant/equipment, and net income, driven by a major transaction that temporarily boosted sales. However, this surge was followed by a sharp decline in net income in Q4 2022 and continued into Q1 2023 with negative income. The financial analysis of RDUS reveals a complex picture: an increase in the debt-equity ratio from 0.8226 to 0.9253 and a rise in the equity multiplier from 1.8226 to 1.9253, indicating a growing dependence on debt. This is further corroborated by the uptick in the long-term debt ratio from 0.3250 to 0.3638. Despite these challenges, including a decrease in liquidity ratios and a negative profit margin, RDUS’s strategic investments in property and equipment have yet to yield the expected returns, suggesting a potential need for optimizing asset utilization and possibly divesting underperforming assets.\nIn light of these financial dynamics, RDUS’s recent investment in new properties and the shift in its capital structure reflect a critical juncture. The company’s increased borrowing costs, evidenced by a slight rise in WACC from 8.9715 to 9.0268, coupled with operational inefficiencies, underscore the urgency for strategic adjustments. The current capital structure, showing a stark contrast with an optimal structure of 40.48% D/E and a WACC of 11.76%, highlights the need for RDUS to rebalance its debt and equity mix. The high current D/E of 98.6% underscores an over-reliance on debt, impacting the firm’s financial flexibility and growth potential. As RDUS navigates this challenging landscape, a focus on reducing debt, improving operational efficiency, and strategically managing its investment in long-term assets becomes paramount for sustainable growth and profitability."

    "text": "At the beginning of 2021, Radius Recycling (RDUS) exhibited a promising upward trajectory in earnings, with fluctuations throughout the year. Yet, by the end of 2022, despite making strategic capital investments in acquiring ten new properties, their sales did not reflect the anticipated growth from these investments. From Q2 of 2023, a noticeable decline in revenue became evident.

    "text": "RDUS Capital Structure analysis\nThe financial analysis of RDUS reveals crucial factors influencing its capital needs. Increases in debt-equity ratio and equity multiplier indicate heightened reliance on debt for growth. This reliance is confirmed by a rise in long-term debt ratio. A slight uptick in WACC suggests higher borrowing costs. Decreases in current and quick ratios imply liquidity challenges. Combined with negative profit margin and reduced asset turnover, these indicate operational inefficiencies driving capital requirements.\nThe observed changes in the company’s financial ratios suggest several factors influencing its need for capital. The increase in the debt-equity ratio, coupled with a higher equity multiplier, indicates that the company has been leveraging more, relying increasingly on debt to finance its operations or growth. This reliance on debt is further corroborated by the rise in the long-term debt ratio. The slight uptick in the WACC suggests that this additional debt might be coming at a higher cost, which could be due to increased market interest rates or a perceived higher risk by lenders. However, the decreased current and quick ratios point to a weakening in short-term liquidity, implying that the company might be struggling to meet its immediate obligations. This, combined with a negative profit margin, may be driving the need for capital to fund day-to-day operations rather than for long-term investments. The reduction in the total asset turnover ratio indicates that the company is not generating revenues from its assets as efficiently as it used to, which could mean that it’s holding longer-life assets that aren’t contributing effectively to revenue generation. The decline in the market to book ratio suggests that the market may not have a favorable view of the company’s growth prospects, perhaps due to these less productive assets or other operational challenges. Given these factors, it seems that the company’s need for capital is being driven by a combination of operational inefficiencies, possibly underperforming longer-life assets, and a higher reliance on debt, which may not be sustainable without an improvement in profitability and asset turnover. The financial strategy may need to focus on optimizing current asset utilization and possibly divesting underperforming longer-life assets to improve liquidity and operational performance."

The debt-equity ratio has increased from 0.8226 to 0.9253. This suggests that the company has taken on more debt relative to its equity over the last year. An increase in this ratio indicates higher financial leverage, which could imply greater risk if the company faces difficulties in meeting its debt obligations. Equity Multiplier: Last year quarterly average: 1.9253, and 7 years quarterly average: 1.8226. The equity multiplier has risen from 1.8226 to 1.9253, indicating that the company has increased its reliance on debt financing compared to equity. This can enhance earnings per share if used effectively, but also increases the risk of financial distress if earnings do not suffice to cover the additional interest expense. Long-term Debt Ratio: Last year quarterly average: 0.3638, and 7 years quarterly average: 0.3250. The long-term debt ratio has gone up from 0.3250 to 0.3638. This means that a larger portion of the company’s assets is financed by long-term debt. While this could allow for more investment in growth, it also implies a higher burden of debt repayment in the future. WACC Cost of Equity: Last year quarterly average: 11.0103, and 7 years quarterly average: 11.0299. There has been a slight decrease in the cost of equity from 11.0299 to 11.0103. This minimal change suggests stability in the investors’ required return for investing in the company’s equity. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): Last year quarterly average: 9.0268, and 7 years quarterly average: 8.9715. The WACC has increased slightly from 8.9715 to 9.0268. This implies that the overall cost of financing the company’s operations has increased, potentially due to a higher cost of debt or a shift in the capital structure towards more expensive sources of capital. Current Ratio: Last year quarterly average: 1.8071, and years quarterly average: 2.0870. The current ratio has decreased from 2.0870 to 1.8071. This may indicate that the company has a lower cushion to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. Typically, a higher current ratio is preferred for indicating better short-term financial health. Total Asset Turnover: Last year quarterly average: 0.4185, and 7 years quarterly average: 0.4589. The total asset turnover has decreased from 0.4589 to 0.4185. A lower ratio suggests the company is not utilizing its assets as efficiently as before to generate sales. This might reflect a less efficient use of assets or slower growth in sales. Quick Ratio: Last year quarterly average: 0.9202, and 7 years quarterly average: 1.1065. The quick ratio has declined from 1.1065 to 0.9202, indicating a decrease in the company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventories. This suggests less liquidity and potentially more risk in the short term. Profit Margin: Last year quarterly average: -0.0101, and 7 years quarterly average: 0.0287. The profit margin has turned negative, moving from 0.0287 to -0.0101. This indicates that the company has moved from being profitable to incurring losses, which is a concerning trend for the company’s operational efficiency and profitability. Times Interest Earned Ratio: Last year quarterly average: 4.0185, and 7 years quarterly average: 22.5852. The times interest earned ratio has drastically decreased from 22.5852 to 4.0185. This significant reduction suggests that the company’s operating income can now cover the interest expense only 4 times, compared to over 22 times previously, signaling a potential risk in the company’s ability to service its debt. Market to Book Ratio: Last year quarterly average: 0.4639, and 7 years quarterly average: 0.6125 The market to book ratio has decreased from 0.6125 to 0.4639. This indicates that the market is valuing the company’s equity at a lower level relative to the book value of the equity. It suggests that investors might perceive the company as being at higher risk or having lower growth prospects."

This suggests RDUS may have higher expectations for returns compared to its peers, possibly reflecting a higher risk profile. Current Ratio: With a Current Ratio Average of 2.09, RDUS exceeds the group average of 1.41. This indicates RDUS has a stronger short-term liquidity position, potentially reducing the need for short-term financing. Debt to Equity: RDUS’s Debt to Equity Average stands at 0.82, which is only slightly above the group mean of 0.73. This indicates that RDUS is moderately leveraged when compared to its peers and may still have room to take on debt if needed. Profit Margin: The group’s Profit Margin Average is 7.37%, with RDUS trailing at 2.87%. This lower profitability metric for RDUS suggests that it’s not capitalizing on revenues as effectively as the average firm in the group. For working capital needs, companies with higher current ratios, like RDUS, might require less temporary working capital due to better liquidity. Conversely, firms with lower current ratios, like RSG, might rely more on short-term funding sources, indicating a different working capital management strategy. In terms of long-term financing preferences, firms with higher debt-to-equity ratios may exhibit a preference for equity to avoid over-leveraging, which can be crucial for maintaining financial flexibility. RDUS, having a moderate debt-to-equity ratio, suggests a balanced approach to using debt financing. Firms preferring longer-life assets might have lower depreciation rates (RDUS has a 4.41% average in past seven years), and vice versa. This preference could be inferred from the ratios related to asset depreciation and PPE (Property, Plant, and Equipment) to total assets. RDUS PPE to assets is 43.89%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPM Average\nCAPM Std Dev\nWACC Average\nWACC Std Dev\nROE Average\nROE Std Dev\nProfit Average\nProfit Std Dev\nROA Average\nROA Std Dev\nEquity Multiplier Average\nEquity Multiplier Std Dev\nEPS Average\nEPS Std Dev\nDebt to Equity Average\nDebt to Equity Std Dev\nTotal Debt Ratio Average\nTotal Debt Ratio Std Dev\nTimes Interest Earned Ratio Average\nTimes Interest Earned Ratio Std Dev\nTotal Asset Turnover Average\nTotal Asset Turnover Std Dev\nROA (EBIT) Average\nROA (EBIT) Std Dev\nPPE to Total Asset Average\nPPE to Total Asset Std Dev\nMarket to Book Ratio Average\nMarket to Book Ratio Std Dev\nDepreciation to Asset Average\nDepreciation to Asset Std Dev\nRetained Earnings to Asset Average\nRetained Earnings to Asset Std Dev\nCurrent Ratio Average\nCurrent Ratio Std Dev\n\n\n\n\nRDUS\n11.029875\n1.948136\n8.971493\n2.098151\n0.027190\n0.031530\n0.028721\n0.033966\n0.015197\n0.017350\n1.822629\n0.138086\n0.667500\n0.856563\n0.822629\n0.138086\n0.448317\n0.041617\n22.585231\n20.727611\n0.458943\n0.082284\n0.019227\n0.018669\n0.378758\n0.027595\n0.612501\n0.173862\n0.001176\n0.003576\n0.530051\n0.038493\n2.087049\n0.448267\n\n\nCLH\n11.105211\n1.932593\n8.413957\n1.378095\n0.029201\n0.024837\n0.042989\n0.035987\n0.009174\n0.007738\n3.237475\n0.199054\n0.832143\n0.779389\n2.237475\n0.199054\n0.690002\n0.018887\n6.984479\n1.879070\n0.208511\n0.014880\n0.016629\n0.008640\n0.381574\n0.042431\n0.993274\n0.206176\n0.015325\n0.002022\n0.213700\n0.040253\n2.109437\n0.172740\n\n\nCWST\n8.427256\n0.836534\n7.223019\n0.745620\n-0.088841\n0.862035\n0.035766\n0.103015\n0.006295\n0.023691\n-6.765790\n28.398694\n0.166667\n0.393954\n-7.765790\n28.398694\n0.832655\n0.177813\n6.330091\n3.394934\n0.203688\n0.035851\n0.011613\n0.020679\n0.499063\n0.068641\n2.261807\n0.669287\n0.006958\n0.008805\n-0.352911\n0.211139\n1.178753\n0.470265\n\n\nNVRI\n12.908304\n2.030142\n8.447507\n2.270748\n0.028094\n0.132112\n0.038775\n0.206735\n0.007001\n0.034774\n5.318344\n2.086635\n0.168571\n1.085759\n4.318344\n2.086635\n0.789324\n0.063988\n5.725970\n4.078773\n0.188644\n0.036724\n0.010283\n0.011918\n0.247245\n0.034681\n0.590322\n0.343290\n0.014058\n0.003602\n0.659116\n0.085068\n1.423360\n0.112490\n\n\nRSG\n8.242936\n0.908993\n6.876832\n0.852449\n0.035805\n0.010990\n0.108619\n0.032341\n0.012852\n0.004061\n2.785827\n0.108546\n0.952500\n0.320296\n1.785827\n0.108546\n0.640535\n0.013465\n8.493024\n1.290553\n0.117962\n0.005006\n0.020631\n0.001745\n0.368256\n0.004086\n1.285557\n0.229460\n0.011006\n0.002190\n0.229860\n0.032703\n0.641077\n0.117319\n\n\nWM\n8.038204\n0.843975\n6.919511\n0.878791\n0.071997\n0.020225\n0.113703\n0.030179\n0.018083\n0.005500\n4.000961\n0.350649\n1.130357\n0.310763\n3.000961\n0.350649\n0.748278\n0.021170\n2.474798\n4.884724\n0.158123\n0.011872\n0.027521\n0.003892\n0.502974\n0.021338\n1.885263\n0.257396\n0.013677\n0.002618\n0.407281\n0.023173\n0.998284\n0.369031"

    "text": "WACC, CAPM, and ROE Group Comparison\nThe following graphs show the quarterly WACC, CAPM (WACC cost of equity), and ROE for each company in the group for the past 28 quarters with Q4 2023 as the latest report.\nThe subsequent analysis examines the quarterly trends of Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), and Return on Equity (ROE) for RDUS and the group spanning 28 quarters up to Q4 2023. An upward trajectory in CAPM suggests heightened investor demands for return, potentially attributable to increased market volatility, RDUS’s stock beta, or a surge in the market risk premium. Notably, both CAPM and WACC exhibit a consistent upward trend, indicating a rising cost of capital for RDUS, with periodic disparities reflecting shifts in the company’s capital structure or market conditions. If CAPM is increasing, it suggests that investors require a higher rate of return to compensate for the higher perceived risk associated with RDUS’s equity. This could be due to increasing market volatility, a higher beta for RDUS’s stock indicating that it is more volatile than the market, or an increase in the market risk premium. WACC Trend: WACC considers the cost of equity (as given by CAPM) but also includes the costs of other types of financing such as debt and preferred stock, weighted by their proportion in the company’s capital structure. The trend of WACC is indicative of the overall cost of financing for RDUS. An increasing WACC could mean that the company’s borrowing costs are increasing, or it could reflect a shift toward more expensive forms of capital like equity. Both CAPM and WACC are trending upwards over time, which implies that the cost of capital for RDUS is increasing. The gap between CAPM and WACC at certain points could indicate changes in the company’s capital structure, such as issuing more equity or debt, changes in the risk-free rate, market risk premium, or the company’s beta. The gap noticeably becomes greater during covid, but that had to do a lot with all the government covid packages, but putting the covid abnormality aside, starting with Q1 of 2022 we can see a larger gap between WACC and CAPM, and it has kept about the same distance since. If the CAPM consistently sits above WACC, it might suggest that equity is a more expensive source of capital for RDUS than debt or other forms of financing. RDUS might be seen as becoming riskier (hence the increasing CAPM), or it may be utilizing more expensive capital which increases the WACC. From a strategic standpoint, RDUS might consider the following based on these patterns: - Reassessing Risk: Understand why the expected return on equity is rising. If it’s due to an increased beta, they might want to look into why their stock is more volatile and if there are ways to mitigate this risk. - Capital Restructuring: If WACC is increasing, it might be beneficial for the company to reassess its capital structure. It might be advantageous to shift towards more debt financing if it can be obtained at lower interest rates, assuming the company isn’t already too leveraged. - Operational Efficiency: Implement strategies to improve operational efficiency and profitability which can lead to a lower perceived risk and, consequently, a lower cost of capital. - Investor Communication: Clearly communicate with investors to manage expectations and provide transparency about the company’s risk management strategies and future outlook. Strategic considerations for RDUS include risk reassessment, capital restructuring, operational efficiency improvements, and transparent investor communication to manage expectations amidst evolving financial dynamics. Detailed research follows on WACC, CAPM, ROE, and capital structure will complement this analysis, offering deeper insights into RDUS and its competitive landscape."

This suggest RDUS is less profitable than the average of its competitors. When compared individually, RDUS has a lower profit average than all listed competitors. This indicates that RDUS’s performance in terms of profit margin is weaker. In term of standard deviation, RDUS has a profit Std Dev of 3.4%, which is below the group average of 7.37%. This suggests that RDUS’s profits are less volatile than the average of its competitors. RDUS has a lower Profit Std Dev compared to CWST (10.30%) and NVRI (20.67%), indicating that RDUS’s earnings are more stable and less risky. However, RSG (3.23%) and WM (3.02%) have even lower standard deviations, implying that while RDUS has stable profit margins, some competitors are achieving stability with higher average profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRDUS\nCLH\nCWST\nNVRI\nRSG\nWM\ngroup average\n\n\n\n\nProfit Average\n2.87\n4.3\n3.58\n3.88\n10.86\n11.37\n6.14\n\n\nProfit Std Dev\n3.40\n3.6\n10.30\n20.67\n3.23\n3.02\n7.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRDUS appears to be less profitable than its competitors. This could be a concern for investors looking for companies with strong profit margins. RDUS may need to look into operational efficiencies, cost management, or revenue enhancement strategies to improve profitability. The lower standard deviation of RDUS’s profits suggests that the company has a more predictable profit performance. For risk-averse investors, this might be attractive. However, the lower profitability coupled with lower risk might not satisfy investors seeking higher returns for higher risk. RDUS may need to assess its competitive strategies and operational execution. The key focus could be on areas that drive profitability—such as product mix, pricing strategies, market expansion, and cost control. Additionally, RDUS may benefit from a review of its risk management strategies to ensure that while maintaining stable profits, it is not overly conservative in opportunities for growth.From an investment perspective, RDUS might be considered a more conservative play with its stable but lower profit margins. Investors looking for steady performance with lower variability might find RDUS suitable. However, for growth-oriented investors, the companies with higher profit averages and reasonable standard deviations (like RSG and WM) could be more attractive. The following two graphs display the profit margins for the six companies, with CWST, an NVRI in their on graph due to major data outliers from each are distorting the rest of the companies."

    "text": "Financial Leverage, EPS, and ROE: A Comparison\nThe Effect of Financial Leverage\nCurrent vs proposed Capital Structure Analysis: The total assets remain unchanged at $1,692,654 for both scenarios. In the proposed structure, the company is considering taking on $846,327 in debt, indicating a debt-to-equity ratio of 1. The share price remains at $26 for both structures. The number of shares outstanding is almost halved in the proposed structure, from 27,863 to 13,932. The interest rate is constant at 0.60%. With the proposed debt in RDUS’s capital structure, financial leverage shows the negative impact of poor operational performance (negative EBIT). Although leverage can enhance returns when a company is profitable, in RDUS’s case, it increases losses, leading to a worse ROE and lower EPS. This is especially concerning during a recession, where the ability to cover interest expenses becomes more challenging. Current Performance vs. Recession vs Growth: Now (Expected Scenario): Currently, with no debt, RDUS is performing poorly (negative EBIT), but the losses per share and the ROE are less severe than they would be with the proposed capital structure. Recession: In a recession, the negative impact is increase due to the interest expense, leading to larger losses per share and a lower ROE. Growth (Expansion): In a growth scenario, although the company would still incur losses, the proposed structure would result in a smaller loss per share compared to the current structure due to the reduction in the number of shares outstanding, but it is still more detrimental to ROE because of the interest payments. In summary, RDUS’s proposed leverage increases the risk to shareholders by magnifying the impact of operational performance on ROE and EPS. This effect is more noticicble in adverse economic conditions, such as a recession.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nThis next example is assuming RDUS where to go back to their Q3 2019 Total debt ratio of .36. This will mean that RDUS will have to lower their debt to 36.4% from 47.8% of total debt, which will mirror an increase in equity from 52.2% to 63.5% of total assets. RDUS is actually in the center points so adding debt will lower the EPS from ($0.82) to ($1.04). RDUS should not take on debt as they are better off now. There is a higher chance of going into a recession then an expansion. In case of a recession the EPS with no extra debt will be at ($1.26), and with debt it will be at ($1.74). RDUS is better off in improving EBIT as that will benefit them the most at this point. Hovering over the line of the current line we can see that what earnings RDUS to obtain the EPS in the corresponding Y-axis value. Both EBIT and EPS will show when hovering over the lines and or dots. \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nIn this chart the 7 year quaterly average for total assets, Debt, equity, share price, commmon stock, and EBIT for RDUS are use to do the break-even comparison. It is noticible that RDUS has historically been able to pay a dividend. In this example we have RDUS take on $129 million in debt to buy back 4,285 common shares. We can see that shareholders can benefit from RDUS taking on more debt in this situation because they will be earning a higher EPS. This research shows RDUS is very well fit to profit, but its main problem is making a profit. The increasing sin the equity multiplier, and long-term debt ratio have increase for RDUS showing that RDUS has taken on debt for their new capital investments, and this investment have more than a year. RDUS can go from earning negative earnings to making a profit by selling some of their debts and cutting their loses."

We found RDUS optimal capital structure to be 40.48% D/E and a WACC of 11.76%. RDUS current D/E is 98.6% which is extremely high. This shows RDUS is using a lot of debt to finance and grow the value of the firm, but all this debt is actually costing them. They should work towards lowering their debt to improve their capital structure, but they have been doing the opposite these past few years where they have been expanding. They opted to end leases to purchase properties, and that is part of their high debt. This high debt is also helping them obtain a good tax rate, but at a cost. As we can see in the break-even EBIT figure, RDUS’s negative earnings are hurting them and they will be better off without debt according to the break-even EBIT model and the optimal capital structure.\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nThis graph is the same form above, but this one includes the RE line for visual.

The DuPont analysis, which breaks down the components of Return on Equity (ROE), and the pro-forma income statement and balance sheet analysis, reveal that a 10% increase in sales does not significantly improve RDUS’s financial health due to the accompanying increase in costs. The scenarios with an EBIT of $0 and an EBIT of $22 million paint a clearer picture of the company’s financial health under different operating performances.\n\n\nC:\\Users\\eduar\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ipykernel_13824\\1951248249.py:26: FutureWarning:\n\nDataFrame.applymap has been deprecated.

This suggests that simply boosting sales is insufficient, as it likely increases costs proportionately, thus failing to enhance shareholder value. EBIT of $0: This scenario likely represents a break-even point in operations, where RDUS manages a positive, albeit low, ROE of 0.73% and a small net income of $6,432.00. This indicates that even without profit, the company’s financial structure can produce a positive outcome for shareholders. EBIT of 22 Million: This is the most favorable scenario, showcasing a robust ROE of 3.22% and a substantial net income of $28,432.00. This demonstrates that improving operational efficiency to increase EBIT has a significant positive impact on financial performance. The financial indicators strongly suggest that RDUS should prioritize improving EBIT and reducing operational costs. This approach aligns with the company’s financial trend analysis, which indicates operational inefficiencies and an over-reliance on debt, as evidenced by the increased debt-equity ratio and the equity multiplier. Additional research from the paper supports this conclusion. For instance, the dramatic shift in the EPS growth rate and the negative trend in growth during the first quarter of 2024 indicate that capital investments have not been yielding the expected returns. The company’s increased borrowing costs and operational inefficiencies necessitate strategic adjustments. The high debt-to-equity ratio and reliance on debt financing not only diminish financial flexibility but also increase the cost of capital, making it imperative for RDUS to focus on operational efficiencies and possibly divest underperforming assets. Lastly, the optimal capital structure analysis suggests that RDUS’s current high debt-to-equity ratio of 98.6% is far from the optimal 40.48% D/E. The high level of debt financing is costly, as indicated by the WACC of 12.01%, compared to the optimal WACC of 11.76%. RDUS should work towards rebalancing its capital structure by reducing debt to lower its cost of capital and improve profitability. In conclusion, RDUS’s financial analyses and historical performance data underscore the need for a strategic shift toward improving EBIT and lowering operational costs. The best path forward for RDUS, supported by both DuPont analysis and various financial metrics, is to enhance operational efficiency and optimize its capital structure to achieve sustainable growth and profitability."

The M&M propositions indicate the leverage is explained by ROA and ROE when taxes are present or bankruptcy is a perceived possibility. Are any of these ratios correlated with ROE and ROA?\nBase on the regression output, this observations do not explained the capital structure of the firm (debt-equity), as explained this variables explained this part of the debt-equity but the intercept shows there is many more things that impact debt-equity rather than this variables. Total asset turnover has a very high p-value which means it is not statistically significant in this model for the Debt ratio. ROE, and ROA are the only ratios that were statistically significant to the model. In the analysis, ROE and ROA are the only significant ratios, it implies these measures are critical in understanding the firm’s performance and risk profile in relation to the debt ratio. They are consistent with the M&M framework but also highlight the deviations from the ideal conditions proposed by M&M, such as the presence of taxes and bankruptcy risk, which affect the firm’s capital structure decision. This ties back to the M&M propositions, especially when considering implications like taxes and bankruptcy risks, which affect how ROE and ROA relate to the firm’s leverage and overall value.

As the Debt to equity level increases WACC will first enojoy the benefits of the tax shield but will eventually face consequences and expereinced higher cost of equity.

    "text": "P1 Task 4\n4. M&M tell us that a firm cannot increase its value by increasing its debt (Section 16.3), but that increased debt can change the required returns for shareholders. In the text (Section 17.4), we read Ben Graham argues for high dividend payout leading to high market values for a firm.\nHas your firm tended to increase its leverage? Yes, RDUS has increased its reliance on debt for growth as evidenced by increases in debt-equity ratio and equity multiplier.\nDoes your firm pay increased returns to shareholders via dividends? Yes, they pay dividend but is less than a dollar per year per share.\nIf they do, describe how are the dividends paid/net income and the debt ratio are related? Base on previous reports on RDUS (Term paper 1 & 2), RDUS has done several investments that have increased their operational cost, debt, interest, and contractual obligations. The results of this investments has resulted in highest cost of equity due to higher risk for investors. RDUS investment decisions have affected their Debt ratio the most, and the regression model done in this paper gives the dividend pay out ratio a coefficient of 0.1077 and a p-value of 0.225 and thus the dividend pay out ratio is not statistically significant to affect the debt ratio. Base on this results dividends paid/net income and the debt ratio are not related or their is not enough statiscal evidence to determined a relationship.\nIf they do not, how does the firm pay increased returns to shareholders?\nThey don’t increase returns to shareholders, and shareholders have been losing money on RDUS this past couple quaters as their equity in RDUS is losing value like no ones business.",

This might indicate that there are\nstrong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n\nRevised VIF Data:\n                       Variable         VIF\n0         Total Asset Turnover   76.882888\n1         Market to Book ratio   33.587439\n2  Depreciation to Asset ratio  105.755661\n3             Return on Equity    5.233682\n4                Current ratio   30.226975\n5       Dividend Pay Out ratio    1.891196\n\n\n\nMulticollinearity: The revised model still shows multicollinearity concerns, particularly for ‘Total Asset Turnover’, ‘Depreciation to Asset ratio’, and ‘Current ratio’, as indicated by their high VIF values. While ‘Return on Equity’ has a reduced VIF, it’s still above the threshold.\nStatistical Significance: The only variable that shows statistical significance in the revised model is ‘Depreciation to Asset ratio’ (p &lt; 0.05). Other variables do not exhibit statistical significance at the 5% level.\nModel Fit: The R-squared value has decreased to 0.600, suggesting that about 60% of the variability in the Debt-Equity Ratio is explained by this revised model. This is lower than the original model, indicating a reduced explanatory power.\nModel Summary: The regression coefficients indicate how each variable influences the Debt-Equity Ratio. For example, the ‘Depreciation to Asset ratio’ has a large negative coefficient, suggesting a strong inverse relationship with the Debt-Equity Ratio.\n\nGiven these results, it appears that reducing multicollinearity through variable removal slightly compromised the model’s explanatory power.\nLike explained in Part 2 task 1 & 2 most variables in the revised model are not statistically significant, indicating they may not be strong predictors for the firm’s capital structure. The result for ‘Depreciation to Asset ratio’ shows caution, given the remaining multicollinearity issues.",
