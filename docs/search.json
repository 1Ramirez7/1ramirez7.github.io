Initially, we examined players with at least one at-bat in a given year, sorting them by their batting average. Surprisingly, several players had a perfect average of 1.0, though this likely indicates a very low number of at-bats. Next, the focus shifted to those with a minimum of 10 at-bats, revealing more realistic averages with the highest being around 0.64. Finally, we analyzed career batting averages for players with over 100 at-bats, where historical greats like Ty Cobb emerged with an impressive average of around 0.366.

    "text": "Baseball Team Metrics Showdown\nPick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Write an SQL query to get the data you need, then make a graph using Plotly Express to visualize the comparison. What do you learn?\nIn this project, I wanted to research more about the salaries of players. It’s quite common for the player with the most home runs to be paid more than others who don’t hit as many home runs. I ran an SQL query to obtain the average salaries of the top 10 players with the most home runs (HR), and the top ten players with the most hit-by-pitches (HBP). The results were not shocking: the average salary for the top ten HR players was $9,911,355.4, and for HBP, it was $4,604,570.79. Why did I decide to use HBP for comparison? Well, players hitting 60-plus home runs are rare, so I wanted to research which baseball statistic correlated more closely with player salaries. I downloaded player stats from the SQL baseball database and prepared the data for regression analysis. First, I used the 2023 consumer price index (CPI) to convert all salary values to 2023 dollars, ensuring players from 1986 and 2015 were evaluated equally, adjusting for inflation. Since salaries are mostly in the millions of dollars, I took the natural log of the salaries and used that as my independent variable, the main variable considered in the regression analysis. I also removed all players with zero salary values, leaving 1811 players in the data set, as having zero values would render the regression analysis meaningless. The regression analysis showed that HBP had the most correlation with a change in player salary. The results indicated that for every unit increase in HBP, the player’s salary increased by $130,082. For every HR unit increase, the salary increased by $19,683. For every triple (3B) unit increase, the salary decreased by $8,430. For every double (2B) unit increase, the salary increased by $67,764. For every stolen base (SB), the salary increased by $39,741. The regression could only explain 15% of the dependent variable, and all the independent variables in the regression, besides HBP, were not statistically significant. In other words, the regression analysis suggested that there are more independent variables that dictate player salaries. HBP was still statistically significant, indicating it is a significant variable in explaining changes in player salaries, but my regression analysis could not identify the other 85% of independent variables that influence salary changes.\nThis research revealed some interesting insights. It showed that home runs are not as significant in determining player salaries as previously thought. It also showed that players with more triples tend to lose salary, while those with more doubles benefit significantly more. Does this suggest that reaching second base is more advantageous than third base? Further statistical research might reveal two classes of 2B players: those who advance to home and those who end up at 3B but don’t make it home. I hypothesize that players who go from 2B to home are of higher quality than those who stop at 3B. It seems that staying in second place or reaching home guarantees a higher salary, while ending up at 3B might lead to a loss in earnings. SB is ranked just below 2B, and HBP is ranked as having the most significant impact on player salaries. Outside of the statistics, I think better players are hit more often by pitches because pitchers recognize their higher likelihood of hitting the ball, especially home runs, so allowing a walk to first base is more strategic. Players who steal bases, in my opinion, are generally better than those who don’t. In conclusion, I believe players who excel at reaching 2B are more successful, which is why 2B has the most impact on a player’s salary compared to other stats. However, my regression analysis could only account for up to 15% of the salary variations, so there are many other factors affecting player salaries, but HBP is definitely one of them.\n\n\nRead and format data\n# Include and execute your code here\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\nsqlite_file = 'lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'  \ncon = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)\n\n# SQL query for average salary of top 10 players in HBP\nquery_hbp_avg_salary = \"\"\"\nSELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary_hbp\nFROM Salaries\nWHERE playerID IN (\n    SELECT playerID\n    FROM Batting\n    GROUP BY playerID\n    ORDER BY SUM(HBP) DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n);\n\"\"\"\n\n# SQL query for average salary of top 10 players in HR\nquery_hr_avg_salary = \"\"\"\nSELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary_hr\nFROM Salaries\nWHERE playerID IN (\n    SELECT playerID\n    FROM Batting\n    GROUP BY playerID\n    ORDER BY SUM(HR) DESC\n    LIMIT 10\n);\n\"\"\"\n\n# Execute queries and fetch data\navg_salary_hbp = pd.read_sql_query(query_hbp_avg_salary, con)\navg_salary_hr = pd.read_sql_query(query_hr_avg_salary, con)\n\n# Close the database connection\ncon.close()\n\n# Display the results\nprint(\"Average Salary of Top 10 HBP Players:\", avg_salary_hbp.iloc[0, 0])\nprint(\"Average Salary of Top 10 HR Players:\", avg_salary_hr.iloc[0, 0])\n\n\nAverage Salary of Top 10 HBP Players: 5604570.788461538\nAverage Salary of Top 10 HR Players: 9911355.401639344\n\n\nReturning to my initial comparison, although the average salary for the top 10 players in HR and 2B clearly shows that hitting more home runs equates to more money, the statistics indicate that higher 2B numbers result in better salaries. While one player in a league might have the most home runs and be paid the most, multiple players can earn more by achieving higher 2B numbers. If we were all baseball players, we might all aspire to be the top HR hitter, but it is financially smarter to aim for more 2B numbers than to seek glory alone.",
