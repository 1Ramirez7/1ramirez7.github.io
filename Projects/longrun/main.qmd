This project demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and scale complex quantitative systems from scratch. Built using R and Shiny, the Solow–Romer Growth Simulator models long-run economic growth with dynamic experiments, user-driven simulations, and real-time visualizations. The app integrates multivariable calculus-based economic theory with advanced data pipelines, modular simulation logic, and custom plot rendering across dozens of macroeconomic variables. It supports user-defined counterfactuals, endogenous modifications, Excel uploads, and downloadable plots—all within a streamlined UI engineered for exploration and analysis. This project strengthen my ability to turn abstract theory into interactive, scalable, and data-driven tools.
