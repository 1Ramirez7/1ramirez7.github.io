## Repo for all my Projects


**Capital Research for Radius Recycling (RDUS)**

1. **RDUS Capital Structure Analysis:**
   - Conducted a detailed analysis of RDUS's financial leverage and its impact on earnings per share (EPS).
   - Assessed scenarios under different economic conditions (recession, current, and boom) to evaluate debt reliance and working capital strategies.
   - Proposed a shift toward short-term borrowing and asset optimization to improve liquidity.

2. **RDUS Capital Structure Analysis #2:**
   - Explored optimal capital structure using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) framework.
   - Evaluated RDUS's current debt-to-equity ratio against industry standards, recommending a reduction in long-term debt.
   - Highlighted strategies to align with an optimal D/E ratio to lower financial risks and borrowing costs.

3. **RDUS Statistical Research (OLS):**
   - Performed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to investigate the relationship between accounts receivable and net income.
   - Identified key factors affecting RDUS’s profitability, emphasizing the limited explanatory power of receivables on earnings.
   - Recommended extending credit cautiously, supported by data trends and historical averages.

**Applied Time Series Research**

1. **China Export Commodities Time Series Analysis:**
   - Applied time series techniques to analyze trends, seasonality, and irregularities in China's export commodity data from 1990 to the present.
   - Conducted a classical multiplicative decomposition to distinguish long-term growth patterns, seasonal cycles, and random shocks influenced by macroeconomic events.
   - Provided actionable insights into optimizing trade strategies by leveraging seasonal trends and mitigating risks from unpredictable disruptions.

**Intermediate Macroeconomic Model**

1. **Aggregate Demand–Aggregate Supply model**
   - Built the Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) model from scratch using advanced calculus and complex mathematical formulations.
   - Incorporated key parameters like inflation rates, short-run output, and Taylor rule adjustments to simulate dynamic economic behaviors.
   - Developed functions to compute short-run equilibrium, inflation stabilization, and policy effects, relying on rigorous mathematical foundations.
   - Simulated scenarios such as the COVID-19 economic crisis to analyze policy responses, including changes in interest rates and fiscal interventions.
   - Generated visualizations to interpret model outputs and validate theoretical assumptions against real-world data.

**Investment Society Leadership and Financial Research**

2. **Bloomberg Terminal Financial Research:**
   - Developed comprehensive guides and templates for navigating the Bloomberg Terminal to analyze equities, financial statements, and key ratios.
   - Regularly lead presentations as the Investment Society President, teaching students how to effectively use Bloomberg for financial data research and decision-making.
   - Focused on creating efficient workflows, including custom templates for financial analysis and integrating Bloomberg data with Excel for streamlined calculations.
   - Emphasized the importance of understanding field definitions and methodology to ensure accurate and insightful financial analysis.
   - Template link is one of the sample Bloomberg templates I made.
